# Fullstack Angular project

This project was assigned to me where we had a list of requirements and tasks we needed to complete, but the general theme and design wasn't a priority really. 

We had to create methods for CRUD functionality as well as navigation between the pages. We had to set up our own database and server which would handle the communications between the database, the user and the app itself.


It is far from a perfect project and looking back I know there are areas I would focus in a bit more and polish, but I am a firm believer of embracing and showing errors or mistakes as well as well rounded apps/projects.
